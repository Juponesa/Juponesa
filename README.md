- Hi there, I’m @Juponesa (or Juliana Otsuka), a brazilian not-that-young-girl who lived in Japan for 4 years and now I'm back in town.
- I'm currently learning some React.js and a bunch of different things for data science area, like (still basic) Python and some intermediate/advanced SQL. Frontend is like a hobby, though I'm really engaged about this data world. Also trying to get my Japanese language better 😅 aiming for that JLPT N2!
- Hope to see y'all soon 😁
